    <p><h2>Homestyle pasta recipe that's better than the jar!</h2></p>

    <p><h3>This is the Italian way. We must erradicate Prego store bought sauce. It's incredibly easy and delicious. Dedicated and inspired by Lisa, Massimo, Sophia, and Carlo. (Not so much inspired as it is completely ripped off)</h3></p>

    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    
    <p><ul>
        <li>28oz San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
        <li>16oz Dry Spaghetti Noodles</li>
        <li>3-4 Minced Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>1 Pound Ground Beef or Ground Sausage</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp Dry Oregano</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp Dry Basil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp Dry Parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Block of fresh Parmesan (Optional)</li>
        <li>Black Pepper/Pepper Flakes(Optional)</li>

     </ul></p>

     <h1>Steps:</h1>
     
     <p><ol>
        <li>Brown your ground beef in a pan. Season with salt and pepper. Drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>In seperate large pan, coat bottom with olive oil over medium to low heat. </li>
        <li>Add garlic and lightly saute until fragrant and transparent. Be sure heat is not too high or  your garlic will brown. This process will only take a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add your can of tomato sauce and ground beef directly to pan. </li>
        <li>Add your Oregano Basil and Parsley. </li>
        <li>Stir in all ingredients and bring sauce to boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, bring down to low simmer for as long as you'd like! But a minimum of 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Salt your sauce to taste. Optionally add pepper flakes. </li>
        <li>As your sauce is approaching your desired done-ness. Fill large pot with water and bring to boil.</li>
        <li>Once Boiling, Add Salt to water (Should be as salty as the ocean!)</li>
        <li>Add your box of pasta and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>Optionally take a coffee mug and scoop out some of that starchy pasta water towards end of cooking.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta then add back to large pot.</li>
        <li>Grab your pan of pasta sauce and dump into that large pot filled with pasta. </li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium and coat noodles with sauce</li>
        <li>Optionally add some of that starchy water from mug if sauce is too thick.</li>
        <li>Optionally add some extra olive oil to sauce.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat. Plate and serve. Top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
